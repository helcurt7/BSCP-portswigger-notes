*Solution*

In this case it is a simple case so we can jus f12 inspect the website and we saw filename u can see at the right that will help us in this task and
we modify the image?filename=img1.png into image?filename=/../../../etc/passwd

<img width="1905" height="527" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-18 113446" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0bb9dc46-981b-4d94-acd4-fe9a68554b5e" />

normally if we cant see the image in this case so we use burpsuite to see the response
