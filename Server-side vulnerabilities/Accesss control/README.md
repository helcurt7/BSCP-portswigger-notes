robots.txt is a text file that store web crawler use by search engine to disallow or allow to search up to which web directory 

after we saw disallow /administrator-panel we append to the link
<img width="1069" height="570" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92827a15-753a-4949-9c86-da267f498c64" />
